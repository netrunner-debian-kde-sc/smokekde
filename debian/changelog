smokekde (4:4.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3, no changes required.
  * Bump debhelper build dependency to >= 9, and compat to 9.
  * Do not manually export CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS now, since compat v9 does
    that already.
  * Use DEB_LDFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND to append out custom LDFLAGS, instead of
    passing them directly to cmake.
  * Update copyright:
    - switch to copyright-format v1.0
    - add entry for myself, for last year and the current one
  * Bump the smoke-dev-tools and libsmokeqt4-dev build dependencies
    to >= 4:4.7.4.

smokekde (4:4.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ David Palacio ]
  * Remove patches applied upstream:
    - fix_smoke_config_install_path.diff
    - fix-knewstuff2-binding.patch
    - fix-kutils-linking.patch

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Generate libraries shlibs based on the current version.
  * Tighten the various libraries dependencies to the current version.
  * Drop version for the smoke-dev-tools and libsmokeqt4-dev dependencies
    of libsmokekde4-dev; the right versions will be picked because of the
    stricter libsmokebase and libsmokeq* (indirect) dependencies.
  * Bump the smoke-dev-tools and libsmokeqt4-dev build-dependencies to 4.7.1.
  * Manually export CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags now,
    as dpkg-buildpackage does not do that anymore.
